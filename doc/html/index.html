><P
>&#13;      In the 1980s, there was a lot of research done on editors
      for programming languages.  I was very interested in these, in part because
      I was tired of constantly reworking code layout when reworking code
      content.  Also, I wanted help with many of what have come to be called
      refactorings, that are time-consuming and error-prone to carry out.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      I was particularly interested in the method of static semantic
      analysis used the the PSG system.  This does incremental
      analysis on incomplete programs, including type inference in the
      absence of declarations.  Most of the tools I have encountered
      that provide the user with interactive information work mainly
      only on complete and syntactically correct code.  They start to
      rapidly lose capability the minute any edit changes are made.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Unfortunately, interest in these died down, primarily, I
      believe, because they generally used "syntax directed editing",
      where the user constructs code something like building or
      altering an abstract syntax tree, while the code is displayed
      textually.  This turns out to be, in many cases, far more
      difficult to use than just typing text.  Interestingly, a
      variation of this idea has recently resurfaced in tools that
      call for graphiically abutting puzzle-piece-like blocks of
      various shapes, each representing a syntactic construct.  But
      apparently it has not been embraced by programmers with even
      moderate experience.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      I did not give up on the idea of a programming-language-aware editor.
      Instead, I embarked on an attempt to allow user editing in the usual
      textual way, while internally  maintaining a syntactially analyzed
      form of code, upon which layout, refactoring, semantically-aware
      browsing, etc. could be performed by the editor.  Schutz is the
      result of a decades long project to that aim.  So far, about all it
      does is support text editing while maintaing an internal representation
      akin to an abstract syntax tree (AST), plus automated layout of
      the syntactic portions of code.  But it is on the brink of readiness
      to support more sophisticated functions.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This has turned out to be insanely complicated, but I think the behaviors
      it shows mostly necessitate the complication.  Here is a list of design
      goals, many of them more or less achieved.
