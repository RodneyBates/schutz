These tests can't be automated, because they involve actions
prior to the plaback level. Things to test are:

Empty text file test12_11c.m3 opens

Empty pickle file test12_11c.m3_ opens

Trying to open test12_11a.m3_ (which does not exist) 
  prompts for test12_11a.m3 (which does) 
  Afterwards, must delete test12_11a.m3_(which will be created.)

Trying to open test12_11b.m3 (which does not exist) 
  prompts for test12_11a.m3_ (which does) 

A nonexistent text file opens (use test12_11d.m3) 

A nonexistent Pickle file opens (use test12_11e.m3_) 

Shell script cleanup.sh will remove leftover files after these
tests, leaving the directory ready for another round.
