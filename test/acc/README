These tests happed accidentally with changes in the form layout
caused MouseClick events, which were recorded in pixel coordinates
relative to the whole window. to move to different places.  These
were the cases that changed as a result. 

Some had crashes, others just different results.  The crashes
are fixed in these.  

Now, mouse clicks are recorded as MouseClickChar, and are in
character coordinats, relative to the text area of the window,
so no such future accidents should occur.
